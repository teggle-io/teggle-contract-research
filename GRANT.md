# Teggle

## Project Description
Teggle intends to be the very first truly decentralised, censorship resistant and private social network. We intend to create a privacy by default, intuitive to use, performant and mass-adoptable platform.

## Problem / Solution
All the existing blockchain based social networks may solve the issue of censorship, but they do not solve privacy. Everything posted is public by default, with no means to make it otherwise. With the advent of AI, this becomes a very big problem as it means our information can be mined and used against us to create consent.

There are some solutions out there that address privacy, like Zion, but most of them lack one or more aspects of what is needed to create "the next Facebook". In the case of Zion, it also lacks being truly decentralised as each "group" needs to establish their own node and each group can not see the other.

What we are proposing is to develop a solution that can be seen in the eyes of the people as a true replacement for the likes of the current "big tech" offerings. Ideally, being seen as the next evolution, with no compromises.

## Development Roadmap
We will require ~12 months (48 weeks) to complete this milestone of the project. We intend to have 1 developer (David) full-time (60 hours a week @ $100/hr), at a total cost of $288,000.

The project has been planned around 4 week "sprints" and is documented here: https://github.com/orgs/teggle-io/projects/1/views/1

Sprints (4 weeks / 240 hrs):
* Sprint 1 - Omnibus (improving upon what has already been built).
* Sprint 2 - Omnibus (release Omnibus to Secret Network community).
* Sprint 3 - Omnibus enhancements, Create "secret-client-rs" (SN rust client), Build hub.
* Sprint 4 - Indexer, research and build.
* Sprint 5 - Create Teggle web app (UI), Create profile feature.
* Sprint 6 - Content storage, Omnibus enhancements, Notifications feature, View profile feature.
* Sprint 7 - "Add Friend" feature, Create post feature.
* Sprint 8 - View feed feature, Reactions / likes feature.
* Sprint 9 - Reactions / likes feature continued, Post attachments (i.e. gallery).
* Sprint 10 - Comments feature, react to comment feature.
* Sprint 11 - Tokenomics research & implementation.
* Sprint 12 - Governance research & implementation.

Ideally, we can receive payments in 4 disbursements:
* At the beginning of the grant.
* At the start of Sprint 4.
* At the start of Sprint 7.
* At the start of Sprint 10 (or at the end if desired).

We would be willing to consider part payment in SCRTs, up to 25%.
